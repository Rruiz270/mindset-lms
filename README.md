## Learning System Architecture

### Open Entry System
Students can enroll at any time and immediately start taking classes based on their level.

### Level Structure
1. **Starter** (Beginner): Basic English fundamentals
2. **Survivor** (Elementary): Everyday communication
3. **Explorer** (Intermediate): Complex topics and discussions
4. **Expert** (Advanced): Professional and academic English

### Class Flow
1. **Pre-Class Activities**: Exercises to prepare for the topic
2. **Live Class**: 1-hour interactive session (max 10 students)
3. **After-Class Activities**: Homework to reinforce learning

### Credit System
- Students purchase packages (e.g., 80 lessons for 1 year)
- Each live class attendance deducts 1 credit
- Cancellations within 6 hours count as used credits
- Bookings allowed up to 1 hour before class

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/[...nextauth]` - NextAuth.js authentication

### Student APIs
- `GET /api/student/package` - Get student package information
- `GET /api/topics?level=STARTER` - Get topics by level

### Upcoming APIs
- `POST /api/bookings` - Book a class
- `GET /api/bookings` - Get user bookings
- `DELETE /api/bookings/{id}` - Cancel booking
- `GET /api/exercises` - Get exercises by topic and phase

3. **Live Class Slides**: Interactive presentation system
4. **Speech Recognition**: Pronunciation practice and feedback
